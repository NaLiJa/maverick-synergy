/**
 * <p>
 * Each authentication mechanism the server supports should implement this
 * interface. When an authentication request is received from the client the
 * server looks up the authentication method name, for example "password" from
 * the {@link com.maverick.sshd.ConfigurationContext}. To support a new type of
 * SSH authentication mechanism, or to overide an existing implementation you
 * should add its Class object to the ConfigurationContext. This can be acheived
 * by adding the following code to your {@link com.maverick.sshd.SshDaemon} code
 * implementation of the
 * {@link com.maverick.sshd.SshDaemon#configure(ConfigurationContext)} method.
 * <blockquote>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * protected void configure(ConfigurationContext context) {
 * 	context.supportedAuthenticationMechanisms().add(&quot;kerberos@sshtools.com&quot;,
 * 			Class.forName(&quot;com.sshtools.kerberos.SSHKerberos&quot;));
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </blockquote>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <em>The SSH protocol recommends that method names are in the name@domain.com
 * syntax.</em>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The server will initialize your authentication object first by calling the
 * {@link #init(com.maverick.sshd.TransportProtocol, com.maverick.sshd.AuthenticationProtocol, byte[]) }
 * method, you should save the variables provided as these will be required to
 * communicate back to the client. Once initialized the transaction will be
 * started by the server by calling the {@link #startRequest} method. Here you
 * will be provided with the users' name and the request specific data. How you
 * proceed from here depends upon the authentication mechanism, in the standard
 * password authentication mechanism, the password is provided in the request
 * data and a native login takes place. If the authentication is successful your
 * implementation should call the
 * {@link com.maverick.sshd.AuthenticationProtocol#completedAuthentication()}
 * method, if it fails call
 * {@link com.maverick.sshd.AuthenticationProtocol#failedAuthentication()}
 * instead.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If your mechanism require further SSH messages to be sent you send them using
 * {@link com.maverick.sshd.TransportProtocol#sendMessage(SshMessage)} and
 * messages sent by the client will be received by your
 * {@link com.sshtools.common.auth.AuthenticationMechanism#processMessage(byte[])}
 * implementation.
 * </p>
